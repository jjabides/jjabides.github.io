Absent Chess is a variant of Chess where you and the opponent start off with a King and summon pieces near your King each turn.

Rather than waiting for your turn to move your own pieces, you and your opponent may choose to move your pieces in the same turn or delay the movement of a piece for another turn. This allows you to create elaborate setups where several of your own pieces coordinate to attack the enemy King.
