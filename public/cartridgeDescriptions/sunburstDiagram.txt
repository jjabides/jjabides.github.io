The Sunburst Diagram is a temporal radial graph that I developed while working at River Logic. This graph is used to measure Job Units per week in a given year, where Job Units represent VM usage for running certain processes (Jobs).

I've provided a demo you can interact with by clicking on the image at the top. For the graph I made at work, I developed using SVGs, CSS animations, and Knockout.js. For this demo (and for this entire web portfolio), I'm using Vue.js instead of Knockout.
